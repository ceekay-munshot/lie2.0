> Do Indian management teams keep their promises?

A static dashboard that, for any Indian listed company, extracts every
**measurable** management commitment from its earnings-call transcripts and
investor presentations, verifies each against later reported actuals, scores
delivery reliability, and exports a polished multi-page PDF.

**Search a company → dashboard** (credibility score, status donut, slippage
timeline, track-record cards, master promise table) **→ Export PDF.**

This repo is being built in ~12 prompts. **Status: Prompt 1 — Foundation** is
complete (scaffold, Worker + static shell, design system, the data contract,
a provider-agnostic LLM client, and a committed golden fixture). The dashboard,
charts, ingestion pipeline and PDF export land in later prompts. See
[`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for architecture, the data contract and the roadmap.

## Stack

- **Static site, zero build step.** `public/` loads everything from CDN
  (Tailwind Play, Google Fonts, Lucide, ECharts 5) — no bundler, no frontend npm.
- **Cloudflare Worker** (`worker/index.js`) serves assets via the `ASSETS`
  binding and reserves `/api/*` for later.
- **Datastore = committed JSON** under `public/data/`. No database.
- **Pipeline** = Node ESM `.mjs` under `pipeline/`; deps installed `--no-save`,
  `node_modules/` gitignored.
- **LLM layer** is provider-agnostic (OpenAI-compatible): primary Gemini, with
  Groq / Cerebras / Mistral / NVIDIA failover. Keys via env/secrets only.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Run the site + Worker locally
npx wrangler dev            # → http://127.0.0.1:8787

# 2. Validate every company ledger against the JSON Schema
npm run validate            # auto-installs ajv + ajv-formats --no-save

# 3. Check the LLM layer config (no API key required)
npm run llm:selftest        # prints resolved provider/model/baseURL + "config OK"
```

A `GET /api/health` returns `{ "ok": true }`. The home page lists one company —
Vedanta Limited, credibility **26 / E** — loaded from
`public/data/companies/index.json`.

## Configuration (LLM)

Set via environment / Wrangler secrets — never commit keys.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `gemini` | Primary provider key |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | — | Primary provider API key (or `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY`) |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | preset | Override base URL for the primary provider |
| `LLM_MODEL` | preset | Override model for the primary provider |
| `LLM_FALLBACKS` | — | Comma-separated failover providers, in order |

Presets (reconfirmed in Prompt 4): `gemini`, `groq`, `cerebras`, `mistral`,
`nvidia`. See [`pipeline/lib/llm.mjs`](./pipeline/lib/llm.mjs).

## Layout

```
worker/index.js            Cloudflare Worker (ASSETS + /api/*)
schema/                    The data contract (JSON Schema, draft 2020-12)
public/                    Static dashboard (index.html, js/, data/)
pipeline/                  Node ESM scripts: llm.mjs, validate.mjs, gen-index.mjs
wrangler.jsonc             Worker config
```
